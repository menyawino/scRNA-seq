A repository where I practice scRNA-seq analysis by re-analyzing my favorite papers.

All analysis include documentation and simple walkthroughs for anyone who would like to replicate this work.

## What is scRNA-seq

RNA sequencing is an approach to detect and quantify RNA molecules in a biological sample. The problem with this approach is that it gives a collective report of all the RNAs analyzed in a tissue, hindering the direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biologyâ€”the cell. Single Cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) solves this problem by single cell isolation and indexing. This allows for RNA detection and quantification at the cell level, giving a histological insight on the sample that can have multiple applications (Haque et. al., 2017).
