## What is scRNA-seq

RNA sequencing is an approach to detect and quantify RNA molecules in a biological sample. The problem with this approach is that it gives a collective report of all the RNAs analyzed in a tissue, hindering the direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biologyâ€”the cell. Single Cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) solves this problem by single cell isolation and indexing. This allows for RNA detection and quantification at the cell level, giving a histological insight on the sample that can have multiple applications (Haque et. al., 2017). 

## Drugs Tested

- **Trastuzumab**: Targets HER2 and is used in the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. The trastuzumab antibody binds to the juxtamembrane domain of HER2 which downregulates the expression of HER2 and causes downregulation of PI3K pathway signaling and downstream mediators of cell cycle progression such as cyclin D1 (Gajria & Chandarlapaty, 2011). This drug also works for HER2-positive gastric cancer (Shitara et al., 2020).
- **Bevacizumab**: Binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and is used for a variety of cancers, including colorectal, lung, glioblastoma, breast, liver, and kidney cancer.
